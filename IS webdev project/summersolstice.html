<div class="highlight-box-5" style="text-align: left;">
<p>It's two in the morning, then why can't I sleep?</p>
<p>Thoughts race of what's leaving and what I can keep</p>
<p>Rain patters the window, like tears that will fall</p>
<p>And I ponder the darkness that now on me falls.</p>
<p>Who knew that these feelings could flip like a switch?</p>
<p>Security, peace — so now what's the sitch?</p>
<p>I marvel at the creation of feelings so strong</p>
<p>Have these soul-aching holds been inside all along?</p>
<p>I lay at my fig tree feeling so alone</p>
<p>But I look out and up and remember I'm known</p>
<p>These burdens are heavy, these rocks all my own</p>
<p>But I have a Savior who rolls away stones</p>
<p>My cares are His cares, He's felt what I feel</p>
<p>He knows more than anyone that darkness is real</p>
<p>So He smiles at me through His all-knowing tears</p>
<p>Arms lovingly stretched, He says: "Please, come here"</p>
<p>Yes, His arms full of safety and His hands that have healed</p>
<p>From the blind and the sick to the crops in a field</p>
<p>As He tenderly holds me, he's healing my heart</p>
<p>My sorrows replaced with a joy set apart</p>
<p>"For those who repent, that means come unto me</p>
<p>Your trials I know and your pain I can see</p>
<p>I wait for you here where my job is the best</p>
<p>For those heavy-laden I can provide REST</p>
<p>You know where to turn, child, for I'll never leave</p>
<p>My Spirit's the best gift that you could receive</p>
<p>Its fruits are so many and joyous to the soul</p>
<p>Keeping Him a constant companion should always be your goal</p>
<p>He'll remind you of me, and that I'm always near</p>
<p>And when I need to tell you something he will *whisper in your ear*</p>
<p>He'll tell you when you've been forgiven, you'll be happy when you're clean</p>
<p>This is quite important to me, let me show you what I mean."</p>
<p>His hand slides down my shoulder and He places it in mine</p>
<p>He says, "Our Father made you, you are special, loved, divine.</p>
<p>We love you more than anyone and you should know that's true"</p>
<p>Feeling His hands, I look at Him... He says, "I did it all for you."</p>
